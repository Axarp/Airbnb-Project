# Airbnb-Project
Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that connects people looking for accommodations with those wanting to rent out their homes. This project aims to analyze Airbnb data to uncover insights about factors that influence guests' choices, such as neighborhood, room type, price, availability, reviews, service fee, cancellation policy, and house rules. The analysis will help Airbnb enhance its services and provide better recommendations to both hosts and guests.
